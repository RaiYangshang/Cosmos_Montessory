			 <p>If you have any trouble, check out the <a href="user.pdf">user manual</a></p>
			 <p> With exceptional teaching, individualized lessons, self-directed learning, 
			 and a culture of acceptance and support, Kent County educational jewel has
			 offered first-rate Montessori education to children age 2-6 since 1992. 
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 We believe that each child is an individual, which is why no two paths through 
			 Friendship Montessori are the same. Instead of a set curriculum, students are given
			 time and space to follow their talents and interests, learning independently as well
			 as one-on-one with teachers. In everything we do, we focus on educating the whole 
			 child to be a good friend and citizen in addition to a lifelong learner.
